## DeepTraLog

DeepTraLog: Trace-Log Combined Microservice Anomaly Detection through Graph-based Deep Learning

### Raw Dataset

Raw Dataset can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/DeepTraLog/DeepTraLog/tree/main/TraceLogData">Raw Dataset</a>

Log and Span Data related to every error is compressed respectively, you can find the corresponding data in `F*.zip`. The normal data can be found in `normal` folder. All logs, including normal and abnormal ones, is compressed into zip files, you can find them in `alllog` folder , you can run log template extraction on it after unzipped. 

### Processed Graph Data

Processed graph data based on the above raw dataset can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/DeepTraLog/DeepTraLog/tree/main/GraphData">Graph Data</a>
